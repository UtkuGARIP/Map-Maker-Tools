MapMakerTools


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.


It adds commands to the [DeveloperConsole](https://github.com/FINDarkside/TLD-Developer-Console) that aid in mapping the terrain.

Additional commands:

* `MapMaking-HideGrass` - Hides all grass
* `MapMaking-HideTrees` - Hides all trees and bushes, but not rosehips or tree stumps.
* `MapMaking-NoTerrainError` - Produces the most accurate terrain rendering by forcing a very high LOD bias and base map distance, as well as the lowest pixel error.
* `MapMaking-All` - Do all of the above.
* `MapMaking-ResetAll` - Revert all settings back to the previously selected quality settings.


None of the settings will be persistent and revert back to the previously selected quality settings when changing scenes or closing the game.


Requires the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) to be used.
